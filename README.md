# 3way_merge_sort
This documents contains two files for 3 way merge sort algorithm in Py and Java

### Overview
Here, we first duplicate the items in information cluster to another exhibit called fArray. Then, sort the cluster by finding midpoints that partition the exhibit into 3 sections and called sort capability on each exhibit individually. The base instance of recursion is when size of exhibit is 1 and it gets back from the capability. Then converging of exhibits begins lastly the arranged cluster will be in fArray which is duplicated back to gArray.

Time Intricacy: in the event of 2-way Union sort we get the condition: T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)
Likewise, in the event of 3-way Union sort we get the condition: T(n) = 3T(n/3) + O(n)
By tackling it utilizing Expert strategy, we get its intricacy as O(n log 3n).

In spite of the fact that time intricacy looks less contrasted with 2 way consolidate sort, the time taken really may become higher on the grounds that number of examinations in combine capability go higher. Kindly allude For what reason is Parallel Inquiry liked over Ternary Pursuit? for subtleties
